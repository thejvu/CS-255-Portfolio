Portfolio Reflection for the DriverPass Project
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was for a client of the same name, which is a service designed to help individuals better prepare for their driving tests. The client wanted a system that would allow students to access online practice exams and schedule driving lessons. The system would need to facilitate student registration, lesson booking, payment processing, and manage the relationship between students, instructors, and administrators. My role was to create documents that accurately captured the client's needs and design a system that would support those needs.

What did you do particularly well?
I believe the most successful part of my work was capturing the client’s needs in both the business requirements document and the system design document. I took the time to clearly identify the core functions the system needed and translated those into well-structured, understandable technical documentation. Additionally, the UML diagrams I created (such as the use case and activity diagrams) were clear and easy to understand, which would help developers and other stakeholders follow the system's intended workflow.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I were to revise one part, it would be the system limitations section in my design documents. While I highlighted the offline access limitation and third-party integrations, I could have included a more detailed roadmap for future improvements. Specifically, I could have expanded on how the system could gradually improve over time, offering more concrete steps for future phases. This would provide a clearer vision for long-term development and reassure the client about the evolving nature of the system.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
To interpret the user’s needs, I thoroughly reviewed the interview transcript with the DriverPass team and referred back to the client’s goals. The primary user base—students, administrators, and instructors—was key in shaping the system design. I ensured that their needs for easy lesson scheduling, practice tests, and secure payment processing were addressed in both the requirements and system design. Considering the user’s needs is crucial in system design because it ensures that the end product is practical and that users can interact with the system intuitively, making it more likely to be adopted and used successfully.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
My approach to designing software starts with a strong understanding of the client’s needs, followed by the creation of detailed use cases and system models. I find it helpful to first break down the system into user-friendly features, ensuring that all interactions are seamless and intuitive. In the future, I would continue to use a blended modeling approach, incorporating both object-oriented and process models to map out both the structure and flow of the system. I would also consider user feedback during the design phase and iterate the system based on this feedback to make it as effective and user-centered as possible.
